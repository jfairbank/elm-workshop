# Build Web Apps with Elm Workshop

This repo contains demos and exercises for the "Building Web Apps with Elm"
workshop.

## Setup

This workshop uses the wonderful [Ellie App](https://ellie-app.com) for
running Elm demos and exercises. Ellie is to Elm what JSBin or JSFiddle is to
JavaScript.

All you need is a modern browser such as Chrome or Firefox. Make sure you're
able to compile some of the URLs below to verify your OS and browser can use
Ellie. I've seen problems with some Linux distros in the past.
